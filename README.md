This repository demonstrates a common COBOL error: data type mismatch during data movement between fields with different PICTURE clauses. The `bug.cob` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.cob` provides the corrected version.  The error arises from attempting to move a numeric value (`WS-AREA-2`) into an alphanumeric field (`WS-AREA-1`) without proper type handling, potentially causing unexpected output or program termination. The solution involves using appropriate data movement techniques to handle the conversion accurately and prevent potential errors.
